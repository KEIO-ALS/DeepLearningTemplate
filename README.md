# DeepLearningTemplate
A basic deep learning model training environment running image classification models on the CIFAR-10 dataset, build using PyTorch (2.0.1).

## Recommended Development Environment

## Environment building
### Step1. Build a virtual environment
Build a virtual environment in an arbitrary working directory using python's venv.

`cd /path/to/your/working/directory`

`python -m venv venv`

`venv\Scripts\activate.dat`

### Step2. Clone Repository
Clone the repository to your local directory.

`cd venv`

`git clone https://github.com/KEIO-ALS/DeepLearningTemplate.git`


### Step3. Library Installation
Install the libraries required to run.

`cd DeepLearningTemplate`

`..\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
